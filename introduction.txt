The following is a collection of ten songs which are linked to the sub-topics of “Migration, Race and Ethnicity”. I have made sure that the songs themselves are ones which I cherish, so as to create a musically enjoyable experience for the reader/listener. However, the topics which the songs relate to are not pleasant and discuss serious hardships which innocent humans have had to endure. To create this playlist the experiences of migrants and foreigners have been assessed through the use of academic articles and books, as well as data supplied from governmental and non-governmental organisations. The distinct topics of Migration, Race and Ethnicity have been linked to a song which gives us richer insight into the topic at hand through the lens of the musician.
